**Single Source DNA**

-   Item one
-   Item two
-   [pkgname](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgname)

**DNA Mixtures**

-   Item one ( [here's a link](http://sctyner.github.io)). Here's some `code()` style dispatch via MPI.

**Parallel computing: Grid computing**

-   The multiR package by Grose was presented at useR! 2008 but has not been released. It may offer a snow-style framework on a grid computing platform.
-   The [<span class="Rforge">biocep-distrib</span>](https://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/biocep-distrib/) project by Chine offers a Java-based framework for local, Grid, or Cloud computing. It is under active development.

**Glass**

-   Here's a Github package user/repo

**Data**

-   Data from the the book Introduction to Data Analysis with R for Forensic Scientists by James Michael Curran is provided in the [dafs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dafs) package by James Curran and Danny Chang.

**Latent Prints**

-   Finger and shoe

**Handwriting**

-   Here is a Bioconductor package [<span class="BioC">maanova</span>](http://www.Bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maanova.html).

**Steganalysis**

-
